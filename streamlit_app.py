As this dataset represents salary data from the year 2017 to 2021 which is very recent, it could mean that the wage gap that existed earlier has gotten better over time. However, \'other\' gender category salary in STEM jobs is alarmingly low for Data Scientist and Software Engineering Manager roles. The dataset does not mention if \'Other\' refers to non-binary gender roles or the values where gender remains unspecified. Since the total count of \'Other\' is considerably lower compared to Male & Female, we cannot make an inference.  But, a more important thing to note is that, although the wage gap between genders doesn\'t seem to exist, the overall representation of \'women\' and \'other\' in stem jobs is still lower compared to men as can be seen in the below count plot.')
